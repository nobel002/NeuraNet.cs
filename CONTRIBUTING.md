# Contributing
I really apriciate the fact that you want to contribute to this project but for now I will only accept features you've added and I aprove of.
Tough I don't think you'll ever be reading this. But feel free to help and add cool feutures.

## Guidlines
If you realy want to contrbute I only ask you to explain your code with a sumary and comments when the code other wise would be to obscure.
like this.
```cs
/// <summary>
/// A short description of the function
/// </summary>
/// <param name="param">
/// What the parameter does (and its type)
/// </param>
/// <returns>
/// What it returns (and its type).
/// </returns>
double YourAwsomeFunction(double param){
  // Your code here.
  return 0d;
}

```

And for the rest give your variables good names (obviously) and check if it works.
